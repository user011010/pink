    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        This is the Privacy Policy of Benno Weingaertner and various &amp; next versions including Pink web version,
        “Pink: Video Chat” (collectively hereinafter, “Pink”, “us”, “we”, or “our”) and
        is incorporated into and is subject to our Terms of Use which can be
        found at

            >https://user011010.github.io/pink/TOS.html</a
        >
        In this Privacy Policy, we refer to our products and services as the
        “Service.” Please read on to learn more about our data handling
        practices. Your use of the Service signifies that you agree with the
        terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with the terms of this
        Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
    </p>
    <h2>Information we collect</h2>
    <p>
        When you install the Service on your device and register with Pink,
        personally identifiable information about you may be collected during
        the download process for the Service (as requested from you during the
        download process) when you register with us. For registration through
        Pink, you are required to provide your mobile phone number or your email
        address, city location, gender, name, depending on the device(s) you are
        using on the Service. You may also provide personally identifiable
        information, but that is optional. When you log in using your Facebook
        account, we may collect additional information you make available to us
        (see “Your User Profile”) below.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, when you install the Service on your device and register
        with Pink, you may will be asked to allow us access to your address
        book. If you consent, we will have access to contact information in your
        address book on the devices you use for the Service (names, numbers,
        emails, and Facebook ID, but not notes or other personal information in
        your address book) and we will store it on our servers and use it to
        help you use the Service, for example, by synchronizing your Pink
        contacts between different devices you may want to use with the Service.
        If you do not want Pink to store this information, you may opt-out
        through your account settings in the Pink application at any time.
        However we may not be able to offer some of the features that require
        this information.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pink may also collect and gather non-personally identifiable
        information, such as certain profile information including country of
        residence and preferences. In addition, Pink may collect and store
        information about your and others’ usage of and interaction with the
        Service and our websites, including matches, numbers of matches made by
        members, match durations, text messages, usage by geographies, device
        and connection information, IP address, device capability, bandwidth,
        statistics on page views, network type and traffic to and from our
        websites.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pink allows you to share text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and
        other communications in the Pink application with other users, and if
        you choose to do so your text messages, photos, screenshots, videos and
        other communications will be stored on our servers. In addition, if you
        choose to share these items with other Pink users, we may not be able to
        remove them from our servers or make them unavailable to anyone you have
        shared them with. Sending and sharing text messages, photos,
        screenshots, videos or other communications in the Pink application is
        your decision. By choosing to share that information, you should
        understand that you may no longer be able to control how that
        information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending
        in part on your actions or the actions of others with Pink you have
        shared the information). Pink is not responsible for any use or misuse
        of information you share.
    </p>
    <p>
        Pink may also collect and gather user contents (e.g., photos,
        screenshots, comments, and other materials) that you create on the
        Service. Your photo can be taken by other users on the Pink, and If they
        use capturing function provided by the Pink, those photos can be stored
        and used for Pink and 3rd party’s service(eg, Facebook, etc.). You can
        change sharing option of 3rd party on the Pink settings. If you do not
        agree with all the terms of this Privacy Policy, do not use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
        To complete a commerce transaction on Pink item shop, you will be
        requested to provide your payment information, including your credit
        card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address. In
        that event, we will transmit your information securely directly to a
        third party vendor or merchant Pink will collect such information in
        order to process and fulfill your purchase. Pink does not process or
        store your payment information. However, we may store other information
        about your purchases made on the Service, which may include the
        merchant’s name, the date, time and amount of the transaction and other
        behavioral information.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also collect error-reporting information if the Service crashes or
        hangs up so that we can investigate the error and improve the stability
        of the Service for future releases. In general these reports do not
        contain personally identifiable information, or only incidentally. As
        part of these error reports, we receive information about the type and
        version of your device, the device identifier, the time the error
        occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when
        the error occurred. We do not use this information for any purpose other
        than investigating and fixing the error.
    </p>

        shared with your Pink contacts. You control your Profile and you can
        access and modify your Profile from the Pink application at any time. In
        addition, if you register with Pink using your Facebook account (e.g.

        on our servers and, if you give us your express consent, we will have
        access to and may collect certain information that you make available on

        picture, your friend lists and birthdays). Your Profile is available to
        other users of the Service Pink are connected to you on Pink. In
        addition, unless you opt-out (which you may do at any time in the Pink
        application), your Profile is discoverable by other Pink users,
        including by way of example in listings of contacts that will include
        your proximity to other users. You may also “block out” any Pink user in
        your contact list from discovering your Profile at any time. In
        addition, Pink may pre-populate your Profile with certain information
        such as your name and Facebook profile picture if you or your friends
        have logged onto the Service using Facebook.
